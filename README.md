# Count Me Up Scotty

Count Me Up Scotty is a game for younger children to sharpen their math skills. It challenges kids to solve additions, multiplications, ... as quick and correctly as possible.

By tracking their time and keeping score they are challenged to beat their own records of that of their friends.

The students started their journey towards a graphical WPF app based on the console application which can be found at [https://github.com/BioBoost/count-me-up-scotty-terminal-edition](https://github.com/BioBoost/count-me-up-scotty-terminal-edition).
